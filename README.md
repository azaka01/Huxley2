## About

On Rails adds stations locations API on top of the Huxley2 Proxy service

The Huxley2 Proxy service connects to the NRE Darwin feed which is an aggregated real-time train feed for all operators in the UK.

Station Data is downloaded from [Naptan](http://naptan.app.dft.gov.uk/datarequest/help) and other sources where the Naptan data isn't up to date

## Get Started

Check out [the live server](https://onrails.azurewebsites.net/) for API documentation

A [mobile client SDK](https://github.com/IntSoftDev/simian) - currently on Android only - is available that facilitates integration with the proxy.

## Get Your Own

There are detailed instructions on how to host your own instance on Azure in [this blog post](https://unop.uk/huxley-2-release/).
